Added the elarms overloaded version of the WP::process() method.
Added code to ewfeeder.cc to replay directly from a tankfile.
Fixed 64-bit related bug in ewfeeder.cc
o) RawPacket.h - new class for arugment to overloaded process() method.
o) wp.h and wp.cc
	- added virtual bool process(RawPacket &raw) to WP class
	- set WP.use_raw_packet = true and this overloaded process() function will be called.
	Otherwise, the original one: process(Channel ch, TimeStamp starttime, int* samples, int size)
	use_raw_packet defaults to false
o) ewfeeder.h - added
	- bool okDataType()
	- bool readPacketFromFile()
	- int datatype_error_cnt - used to report errors when replaying from a tankfile
o) ewfeeder.cc
	- Added call to second overloaded process() function when WP.use_raw_packet = true
	- Added code to replay directly from a tankfile. This is controlled by two new parameters.
	    Replay = the path/tankfile
	    ReplayRealTime = true or false. If true, slow down the packet feed to simulate real-time. Defaults to false.
	    The tankfile can be optionally gzipped.
	    Added code to wait until the packet queues are empty when replaying.
	    If replaying, the ChannelFile property is used in the call to DataChannel::readChannels(pFactory, channel_file)
	    This allows command-line arguments, for example:
	    	EWP2 replay=20040214_wheelerridge.01.tnk.gz ChannelFile=20040214_wheelerridge.dat
	- removed call to prop->init(config), since this does not allow command-line arguments to be used for the
	  WPPropertiesST properties, in particular the new Replay and ReplayRealTime properties and the ChannelFile.
	- replaced sizeof(waveform_data_type) with data_size=4. The data size will always be 4 bytes with the restriction
	  of datatype trh->datatype to "i4" or "s4".  The "typedef long waveform_data_type" in ewfeeder.h makes
	  sizeof(waveform_data_type) = 8 bytes when compiled as a 64-bit executable.
o) GetProp.cc and GetProp.h
	- Added void GetProp::toDoubleArray(string s, int num, double *values)
o) LockedQueue.h
	- Added int size() which returns the number of packets in the queue.

Consolidating all files
o) GetProp.cc and GetProp.h
	- Moved to utils/ as used widely by non-waveform processing modules
