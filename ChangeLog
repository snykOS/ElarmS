o) Added multiple window-length, multiple frequency-band Pgv measurements to EWP2. These measurements are transmitted in the
TriggerParams message packet to E2. The message format version number was changed to 104 (EWPacket.h). The 11 window-lengths
and 9 frequency-bands can be specified in EWP2.conf. They are used in TriggerParamsTSPModule.cc. testTeleseismicPgv()
New EWP2 parameters in EWP2.conf:
	# Compute variable data window-length and frequency-band Pgv measurements.
	ComputeFBands true
	# Compute frequency-band Pgv measurements for Z-only. If false, compute for Z,N, and E.
	ZFBandsOnly true
	# The beginning of all data windows for the IIR filter in seconds before the trigger time
	WindowLead 30.0
	# The end of all 11 data windows in seconds after the trigger time
	WindowLags 0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9,1.0,2.0
	# There are 9 frequency-bands in Hz: f1min,f1max,f2min,f2max,...f9min,f9max
	# There are three sets for three sample-rate ranges
	# FBands1 is used when the waveform sample rate is < 32 samples per second
	# FBands2 is used when the waveform sample rate is < 96 samples per second
	# FBands3 is used when the waveform sample rate is >= 96 samples per second
	SamprateFBandsMax 32., 96.
	FBands1 6.,8.,6.,8.,6.,8.,3.,6.,1.5,3.,0.75,1.5,0.375,0.75,0.1875,0.375,0.09375,0.1875
	FBands2 12.,16.,8.,12.,6.,8.,3.,6.,1.5,3.,0.75,1.5,0.375,0.75,0.1875,0.375,0.09375,0.1875
	FBands3 24.,48.,12.,24.,6.,12.,3.,6.,1.5,3.,0.75,1.5,0.375,0.75,0.1875,0.375,0.09375,0.1875
E2 uses the Pgv measurements from each data window and frequency band to test individual triggers for teleseismic characteristics.
This test is configurable with new E2 parameters. The teleseismic frequency dependent log10 Pgv amplitude ranges, for
different sample rates are specified in the new parameter file tfparam.dat.
New E2 parameters in E2.conf:
	# Parameters for teleseismic filter based on multiple filter bands and window lengths
	UseTF                   true
	TFFile                  /app/elarms/run/params/tfparam.dat
	TFMaxStaDist            260.    # max allowed station distance for classifying station triggers as teleseismic
	# Window lengths are 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 2.0 seconds
	# TFMinWindowIndex starts at 0, so index 1 is 0.2sec. Require at least this much data for the filter band amplitude calculations
	TFMinWindowIndex        2       # wait for a measurement at this window length from at least TFNumStaRequired stations
	TFLow                   6       # the low frequency filter-band index (0 to NUM_FBANDS-1) An index in the FBands# filter-bands 
	TFHigh                  2       # the high frequency filter-band index (0 to NUM_FBANDS-1)
	TFM2                    1.25    # the trigger is teleseismic only if logPgv[TFLow] > TFM2 * logPgv[TFHigh] + TFB2
	TFB2                    1.40
	TFChannelReverse        false   # true: allow a trigger to change from teleseismic to non-teleseismic
	                                # false: do not allow a trigger to change from teleseismic to non-teleseismic
	TFEventReverse          false   # true: allow an event to change from teleseismic to non-teleseismic
	                                # false: do not allow an event to change from teleseismic to non-teleseismic
	TFDisagreeSta           1       # 0: if two channels at a station disagree, count the station as non-teleseismic
	                                # 1: if two channels at a station disagree, count the station as teleseismic
	TFNumStaRequired        2       # the number of agreeing stations required to declare the state of the event
Teleseismic Trigger Test: If all 9 logPgv values are within the ranges for the data window length (tfparam.dat) and
(logPgv[TFLow] - (TFM2*logPgv[TFHigh] + TFB2)) is > 0, the trigger is classified as teleseismic.

The test for a teleseismic event is in E2Alert::checkTeleFBands()
  If the triggers from TFNumStaRequired stations within TFMaxStaDist km are teleseismic, then flag the event as
    teleseismic and block the alert.
  else if the triggers from TFNumStaRequired stations within TFMaxStaDist km are not teleseismic, then flag the event
    as NON-teleseismic do not block the alert.
  else if all stations are within TFMaxStaDist km, block the current alert and wait for more data.
  else if some stations are greater than TFMaxStaDist km, flag the event as undecided and do not block the alert.

o) Added EWP2 method to the ProcessBuffer api to get waveform data for teleseismic amplitude measurements.
o) Fixed a bug in E2Trigger.cc that prevented negative maximum Pd values from updating the station and event magnitudes.
o) Added a check for near-flat-line data in ToGroundTSPModule.cc that could cause a numerical overflow and program crash.
o) Fixed EWP2.cc bug that caused a fixed size array that holds four seconds of trigger packet information to overflow and
crash when the packet size was small enough to have more than 20 packets within 4 seconds. (For example NP.7040.HNZ)
The fix will allow any number of packets within 4 seconds.
o) Added Mailx parameter to EWP2 to specify the path to mailx, which is used to send a warning email when messages cannot be
sent to the activemq.

o) Added calculation of station travel time error for iterations that do not call the location method. This insures that the
event trigger lines in the log file always show a valid "tterr" column.

o) Changed the log file trigger lines. The new format requires fewer lines:

o) Added trigger teleseismic filter lines to the log file:
     sta chan net loc      lat       lon            trigger-time  U C  lead  lag npts  Pgv1  T1  Pgv2 T2  Pgv3 T3  Pgv4 T4  Pgv5 T5  Pgv6 T6  Pgv7 T7  Pgv8 T8  Pgv9 T9 TTest TF
F:  SBB2  HHZ  CI  --  34.6884 -117.8242 2016-08-03T00:00:00.378  0 Z 30.00 0.10 3011 -4.068 T -4.519 T -5.037 T -5.603 F -5.562 F -5.523 F -5.258 T -4.672 T -4.743 T -0.361 F
The test for a teleseismic trigger is T1 to T9 are true and TTest is > 0., where TTest is logPgv[TFLow] - (TFM2*logPgv[TFHigh] + TFB2);
	U: trigger update index
	C: component
	lead: the start of the data window for the IIR filter in seconds before the trigger time
	lag: the end of the data window for the IIR filter in seconds after the trigger time
	the 11 lag values are: 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0 and 2.0 seconds.
	npts: the number of samples in the data window for the IIR filter
	PgvN: Peak ground velocity amplitude measure for this time window and the N'th frequency band.
	TN: T/F - true of false - is the PgvN value between the amplitude limits for a teleseismic signal. Amplitude limits are in tfparam.dat
	TTest: logPgv[TFLow] - (TFM2*logPgv[TFHigh] + TFB2)
	TF: If all T2 through T9 are 'T' and TTest (logPgv[TFLow] - (TFM2*logPgv[TFHigh] + TFB2)) is > 0, the trigger is classified as teleseismic

o) Correct the magnitude calculation in E2Magnitude.cc for a single-station-alert. Currently a single-station-alert is not allowed.
o) Correct the formats in some snprintf() calls with size_t arguments to avoid compiler warnings when using -m64.
o) Added a "Verbose" parameter to EWP2. The default is Verbose=1, which prints only the Trigger and T: lines to the log. To print
the "P:" lines (packet info) and the new "F:" lines (teleseismic-filtered-amplitudes), set Verbose=2.

o) Added new option to the ewfeeder class (lib wplite) to read Tracebuf2 messages from a tank file, optionally gzipped. The
EWP2 new command line arguments are "replay=" and "ChannelFile=":
EWP2 ../params/EWP2.conf replay=${TANK_DIR}/19991016_hectormine.01.tnk.gz ChannelFile=${TANK_DIR}/19991016_hectormine.dat
The replay= argument can point to a tankfile or a directory of tankfiles.

o) Added E2 command line argument "-replay". This tells E2 to use the TrigBufferSeconds parameter (default=0.1 seconds) to 
limit the trigger pool that is passed to the associator to TrigBufferSeconds seconds. This is optional for the replay.

o) Removed all references to leap second time. The leap second file is no longer used by EWP2 and E2.
All epoch times in EWP2 and E2, and in the binary messages between them, are UNIX epoch time.
